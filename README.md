Hello,

I'm Paweł Szajwaj and I am a kind of a jack of all trades. Although I've completed my engineer's degree in Acoustics, I have a lot of interest in programing. 

I'm familiar with 
matlab (done few school projects), 
python (mostly pandas and seaborn), 
LabView, 
C++ (mostly with JUCE framework) 
C# (published one little game, http://student.agh.edu.pl/~szajwaj/amogus/).
